The Library

Create a REST app for library. You can loan and return books from it. Books are hardcoded into the 
database. 

Data will be about books 

{
	_id:number, //(autogenerated)
	name:string,
	author:string,
	year:number,
	genre:string,
	loaned:boolean
}

GET /api/loan
	get available books (loaned:false)

GET /api/books
	get all books regardless of loaned status
	
PUT /api/books/:id
	if the book is available change it to loaned and if loaned change it to available.
	
Test with Insomnia. Then create a frontend using javascript as a single page application.
